# Advent of code 2023 in Mysql


All sql scripts require a table with the pattern day_[daynumber] with 0-padding. This table should contain a single column called 'data' of type text. 
For each line in the source data there should be a separate record in the table for the scripts to work.


As of day 7 this requires a minimum of MySQL 8.0.19
